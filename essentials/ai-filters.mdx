## What are AI Filters?

Each AI filter is a specialized Machine Learning (ML) model designed to enhance videos in a specific way. TensorPix provides a variety of AI filters that can be applied to your videos to achieve different effects, such as uspcaling, deblurring, denoising...


## Listing filters

To see which filters are available, you can call the `/api/ml-models/` endpoint. This will return a list of all available AI filters along with their details.


## Applying filters

You can apply 1 or more filters to each video. Maximum number of filters that can be applied to a single video limited by your [subscription plan](https://app.tensorpix.ai/billing).

<Note>Specified order of filters is irrelevant. The system chooses the optimal order when you submit the job.</Note>

<Warning>Some filters have an input video resolution limit. If you exceed the limit, the request will fail with status code `400` and an appropriate message. Resolution limit is displayed when listing filters using the `/api/ml-models/` endpoint.</Warning>
