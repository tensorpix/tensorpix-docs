        Enhances a single image hosted on an publicly accessible  URL, for example: https://sample-image.com/image.jpg

        If your videos are stored on S3 or another provider, you can directly enhance images using this endpoint without needing to upload the image first.

        > **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the image URL is either publicly accessible or [presigned](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) if stored privately on S3 or similar platforms. For presigned URLs, we recommend setting the signature expiry to at least 2 hours to avoid potential access errors.

        ## Supported URLs

        We support direct URLs to image resources only.

        If the URL cannot be parsed as an image, the endpoint will return a status code of `400`.

        Enhance the uploaded video. To upload the video, use the [upload videos endpoint](https://backend.tensorpix.ai/api/schema/redoc/#tag/videos/operation/videos_create). After the video is uploaded, use this endpoint to start the video enhancing job. Make sure to set the `input_video` attribute to the uploaded video's ID which is returned in the response of the [upload videos endpoint](https://backend.tensorpix.ai/api/schema/redoc/#tag/videos/operation/videos_create).


        ## AI filters

        AI filters are called `ml-models` in the API docs as they are actually machine learning
        models.

        See the `/api/ml-models` to learn more about ML models selection. After choosing the appropriate models, pass the list of their IDs in the `ml_models` parameter. You should pass at least one AI filter.

        ## Free Preview Jobs

        Free Previews will process a short segment of the video (10sec) and won't cost any 🪙 Credits. To enable Free Previews in a job, set the `preview = True`.

        You can use the `start_frame` to set the starting frame of the Free Preview segment.
        `end_frame` parameter is ignored if `preview = True`.

        ## Enhancing specific video segments

        To process a whole video, don't specify `start_frame` and `end_frame` and set
        `preview = False`.

        To process a specific video segment, set the `start_frame` to the starting frame of the
          segment, and `end_frame` to the end frame of the segment. `end_frame` must
          be > `start_frame`.

        ## Stabilization

        `stabilization_smoothing` parameter is ignored unless the AI Stabilization Filter is set as
        one of the ML models.

        ## Sharpening

        `sharpen_strength` parameter is ignored unless the AI Sharpen Filter is set as
        one of the ML models.

        ## Post enhancing clean-up

        > **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Your account will be limited by the total storage of all enhanced and uploaded videos. While this limit will be set to a high number (1TB+), we highly recommend you delete the enhanced video after the enhanced video is copied to your server. This ensures you won't run into storage limit errors in the future.

        Starts a job that enhances a video hosted on an publicly accessible  URL,

        for example: https://sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4

        If your videos are stored on S3 or another provider, you can directly start the enhancement job using this endpoint without needing to upload the video first.

        > **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the video URL is either publicly accessible or [presigned](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) if stored privately on S3 or similar platforms. For presigned URLs, we recommend setting the signature expiry to at least 2 hours to avoid potential job failures.

        ## Supported URLs

        We support direct URLs to video resources only. Third-party hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Vimeo, or TikTok are not supported.

        If the URL cannot be parsed as a video, the endpoint will return a status code of `400`.

        > **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Your account will be limited by the total storage of all enhanced and uploaded videos. While this limit will be set to a high number (1TB+), we highly recommend you delete the enhanced video after the enhanced video is copied to your server. This ensures you won't run into storage limit errors in the future.

        The terms "AI Filters" and "ML Models" refer to the same concept.
        - "AI Filter" is a more user-friendly term often used in user interfaces.
        - "ML Model" is commonly found in technical documentation such as API references.

        Each ML model belongs to one task. E.g. `200% AI Upscale` would belong to a `Super Resolution` task group. When selecting models for a video, one can only select one ML model per task group.

        Visit the the [Help Center](https://help.tensorpix.ai/en/collections/5832762-ai-filters) for more detailed information about each ML model and its capabilities.
